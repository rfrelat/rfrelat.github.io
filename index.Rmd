## Bio

Data scientist and quantitative ecologist. In the last ten years, I transformed large and diverse datasets into publishable information with geographers, climatologists, agronomists, ecologists and fisheries scientists based in Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin America.   

I develop open source software (especially in R) to help colleagues conducting creative, robust and repeatable data analysis. Interested ? [Contact me.](mailto:rom.frelat@gmail.com)

Below is a list of some of the recent tools I developed:  

-   [Tutorial and workshops](https://rfrelat.github.io/portfolio.html#tuto) to share novel statistical tools to broader audience

-   [Data dashboard](https://rfrelat.github.io/portfolio.html#shiny) for interactive data analysis

-   [Contribution to open science](https://rfrelat.github.io/portfolio.html#open) with data and scripts deposited in repository for robust and repeatable science.
