#Collection of R ressources for students & scientists
Developed by R. Frelat

All ressources suppose basic knowledge of the [statistical software R](https://cran.r-project.org/). 
If you feel too unconfortable with R, I would advice first to learn the R syntax, data types, loading and plotting of data on the interactive interface : http://tryr.codeschool.com/

# [Introduction to multivariate analysis : from 2D to 3D](https://rfrelat.github.io/Multivariate2D3D.html)
Companion tutorial of:  
Frelat R, Lindegren M, Dencker TS, Floeter J, Fock HO, Sguotti C, Stäbler M, Otto SA and Möllmann C (2017). Community ecology in 3D: Tensor decomposition reveals spatio-temporal dynamics of large ecological communities. PLoS ONE, 12(11): e0188205. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0188205
